# Cryptographic_toolkit

A set of tools, techniques, and protocols used for the encryption, decryption, authentication, and integrity of digital data is known as a cryptographic toolkit. Several cryptographic methods, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, hash functions, and key exchange protocols, are often included in a cryptographic toolkit. In this project, we have tried to implement Affine, Vigenere, Caesar, and DES cryptographic functions. Affine, vigenere, and caesar are based on substitution cryptography whereas DES, a block cipher uses permutation, substitution, and round key generator functions. Substitution and Block ciphers are traditional and more popular
